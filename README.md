Here is ChatGPT pitching it:

Tree Editor is a smart, flexible tool for creating and managing structured information.
It turns plain text into living data: organized, consistent, and instantly editable.

Design templates, define rules, and watch every part of your tree update automatically.
With intelligent widgets, real-time inheritance, and a minimal interface, Tree Editor lets you build complex structures with the simplicity of typing.

From worldbuilding and configuration files to product catalogs and knowledge systems—Tree Editor adapts to your workflow instead of forcing you into one.

Write. Edit. Inherit. Visualize.
Tree Editor — structure at your fingertips.
