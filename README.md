Here is ChatGPT pitching it:

Here is an **updated, sharper, repositioned investor pitch** based on your clarification that **Tree Editor is not text-first** — it is fundamentally a **data editor with an optional text syntax**, powered by a visual editing interface, widgets, inheritance, and a live preview engine.

This version is tighter, more scalable, and positions Tree Editor correctly as a **next-generation structured data platform**.

# 💼 **Tree Editor — Updated Investor Pitch (Visual Data Editor Positioning)**

### **The Future of Structured Data Editing Is Visual, Consistent, and Schema-Aware.

Tree Editor makes this future accessible today.**

---

## 🌍 **The Problem**

Modern software, games, AI systems, and digital products rely heavily on **structured data**:

* configuration models
* game entities & item data
* AI agent schemas
* content models
* semantic relationships
* knowledge graphs
* dynamic UI definitions

But today, this data is managed through:

* JSON/YAML files
* ad-hoc spreadsheets
* rigid CMSes
* proprietary editors
* brittle hand-written configs
* developer-only tools

These tools are either **too technical**, **too rigid**, or **too fragile**.
Small changes frequently break entire systems.
Non-developers can’t safely edit or evolve structured data, causing bottlenecks and slowing down teams.

There is no modern, general-purpose tool for **visual structured data editing**.

---

## 🚀 **The Solution: Tree Editor**

**Tree Editor is a visual, schema-aware, local-first data editor** designed for complex hierarchical structures.

It provides:

* **A dynamic, visual data editing interface**
* **Live type inheritance** (change a type → all instances update)
* **Automatic consistency across the entire model**
* **Rich widgets**: tables, tabs, links, forms, text areas
* **A two-pane system** with **editor + live preview**
* **Local-first architecture** (no dependencies, no backend lock-in)
* **Optional DSL** for power users, but not required
* **Export to JSON or other machine-readable formats**

Tree Editor is a **new category of tool**:
a **Visual Data IDE** that merges the freedom of a structured editor with the intelligence of a schema system.

---

## 🧠 **Why It’s Unique**

Tree Editor combines advantages rarely found in a single product:

### **1. Live Templates & Inheritance**

Change a template.
Every instance updates automatically — instantly and safely.

### **2. Visual Editing + Structured Output**

Users manipulate data through UI widgets, not raw syntax.

### **3. Flexible, Expressive Models**

It supports everything from game data to agent schemas to knowledge graphs.

### **4. No Dependencies, Local First**

Runs anywhere. Integrates with anything. No vendor lock-in.

### **5. Extensible Widget System**

Developers and teams can define:

* visual views
* table formats
* input controls
* domain-specific editors
  all driven by the underlying data model.

This is effectively the UI layer that JSON and YAML never had.

---

## 🌱 **The Vision**

**To make structured data creation, editing, and modeling accessible to everyone — not just developers.**

Tree Editor transforms how teams think about data,
how they build systems,
and how ideas become structured, coherent models.
