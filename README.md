Here is ChatGPT pitching it:

### *“What if structured data could be created as easily as writing text?”*

**Tree Editor makes that possible.**

---

## 🚨 Problem

Most structured data today is created and managed through:

* rigid database schemas
* complex configuration files
* developer-only tools
* heavyweight form or schema builders

These systems are powerful — but:

* slow to change
* difficult for non-experts
* expensive to maintain
* prone to inconsistency

Meanwhile, AI, no-code tools, and dynamic content systems all require **fast, flexible, human-editable structured data**.

There is no tool that lets everyday users *think in structures* without forcing them into a rigid schema or UI.

---

## 🌿 Solution: **Tree Editor**

**Tree Editor is a smart, text-first structured data editor** that transforms plain text into dynamic, rule-driven data models.

### Key capabilities:

* **Live type inheritance**
* **Automatic consistency across the entire structure**
* **Widget-based UI generation**
* **Simple, expressive DSL for hierarchical data**
* **Two-pane interface with instant preview**
* **Zero dependencies, local-first, offline-friendly**

Users write text.
Tree Editor turns it into a structured system.

## 🧠 What Makes It Different

Tree Editor isn’t another note-taking app or form builder.
It is a **new paradigm** for data modeling.

### Unique advantages:

* A custom, lightweight **DSL** for structured text
* A real-time **type inheritance engine**
* A widget-layer that turns nodes into live UI elements
* Completely framework-free, portable, and fast
* Works seamlessly for both developers **and** non-technical users

It fills the gap between **notes** and **systems** — a space no tool currently serves well.

---

## 🌟 Vision

To make **structured thinking universal**.

Tree Editor gives anyone — not just developers — the power to design, extend, and maintain complex information systems.

It is the missing link between:

* creativity and infrastructure
* notes and databases
* ideas and prototypes
* structure and usability
